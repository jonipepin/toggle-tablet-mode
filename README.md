## Toggle Tablet Mode ##

### Overview ###

This simple program toggles between tablet mode and normal mode on Gnome-based Ubuntu distros.

I wrote this script for my personal use, and provide no guarantees that it will work for you. If it does work for you, let us know your setup so others can benefit from your experience!

**Important** - when in tablet mode, your laptop's keyboard and touchpad are disabled. DO NOT USE on laptops without a touchscreen!

### Install Directions ###

* `cd [download directory]`
* `sudo ./install.sh`

**Test Machine**

This is the configuration of the laptop that I used to write and test the program
* Ubuntu 20.10
* Gnome
* Dell Latitude 2-in-1
